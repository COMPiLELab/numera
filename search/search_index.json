This two-day workshop will take place on April 11 and April 12, 2024, hosted by the International Center of Mathematical Sciences (ICMS) within the Bayes Center, Edinburgh (UK). It aims at bringing together experts at in the field of numerical analysis and its interface with data science. The meeting is dedicated to the 60th birthday of Desmond J. Higham About As the size of data and models is growing at an unprecedented pace, the possibility of reducing dimension and computational resources while maintaining performance and robustness is one of the key challenges of modern data science and machine learning. While advancements in software and hardware have made it possible to develop data-led tools of massive scale by allocating increasing resources, we can draw upon decades of fundamental research in numerical analysis and scientific computing to recognize the immense impact of reducing model size and computational complexity in the design, implementation, and widespread adoption of scientific software for large-scale problems. This workshop wants to bring together experts at the interface between (mathematics of) data science, numerical analysis, and scientific computing and will allow us to discuss the newest trends in numerical analysis, with a focus on the main aspects numerical analysis could contribute to the growing fields of data science and machine learning. The primary objective of the workshop is to capitalise on the occasion to bring together researchers in numerical analysis and related fields to discuss the latest developments, exchange ideas, and foster new collaborations. We anticipate that the newly formed collaborations, as well as the well-established ones, will produce several outputs on prestigious journals. Location International Center of Mathematical Sciences (ICMS) The Bayes Centre, 47 Potterrow, Edinburgh, EH8 9BT Keynote Speakers Elena Celledoni, Norwegian University of Science and Technology Peter Grindrod, University of Oxford Francoise Tisseur, University of Manchester Ivan Tyukin, King's College London Jesus-Maria Sanz-Serna, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid Peter Kloeden, University of Tubingen Nicholas J.

Please register your participation at: http://www.abcdefg.com Local Information Edinburgh is well-served by public bus transport. All buses accept contactless payment. A single journey ticket is \u00a32.00 and there is a daily cap of \u00a34.00. If you prefer paying by cash, please note that buses in Edinburgh are not equipped to give change. You should carry a selection of coins in order to have the exact fare. Many of the bus routes pass close to through 47 Potterrow (The Bayes Center). Download the Lothian Buses app or use Google Maps to find the best route for you. Further details to get to the ICMS are available at: https://www.icms.org.uk/find-us Organized by Francesca Arrigo and Francesco Tudisco","title":"Home"},{"location":"#numerical-analysis-in-the-era-of-data-science","text":"Welcome to the Numerical Analysis in the Era of Data Science workshop.
